Founding Engineer at Intent.
We at Intent are on a mission to make meal planning effortless and---more broadly---to solve the perennial problem of deciding what to eat.
Some households struggle with picky eaters.
Others operate on a tight budget.
Yet others have exact macronutrient requirements.
I spend my days crafting our core meal plan generation algorithms to provide our users with meal plans tailored to their needs.
