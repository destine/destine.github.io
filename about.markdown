Founding Engineer at Intent.
We at Intent are on a mission to make meal planning effortless and---more broadly---to solve the perennial problem of deciding what to eat.
Some households struggle with picky eaters.
Others operate on a tight budget.
Yet others have exact macronutrient requirements.
I spend my days crafting our core meal plan generation algorithms to provide our users with meal plans tailored to their needs.
However, these needs are not always evident.
This is where OpenAI enters the equation.

Recently, I am experimenting with conversation as an alternative means of understanding the unique challenges each user faces.
Our working hypothesis posits that this modality allows users to be more expressive than the questionnaire could ever allow them to be.
Further, our current work integrating ChatGPT with a contextual bandit shows promise of realizing this hypothesis.
At the upcoming OpenAI DevDay, I eagerly anticipate both learning from the experiences of fellow developers and sharing our own journey in this exciting endeavor.
